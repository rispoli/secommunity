Notes:
------
  Between these examples and the accompanying paper the following equivalences
  hold:
    says(S, pca(P, C)) <==> pcas(S, P, C)
    says(S, neg(pca(P, C))) <==> not pcas(S, P, C)
  where S, P, C are variables ranging over Sources, Principals and Categories
  respectively and with 'not' we mean DLV's classical negation, not NAF.
