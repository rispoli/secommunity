:<<DLV-Server README file

Usage:
------
  'dlv-server[.exe] --help' for online help.
  examples/*.dlv for Knowledge Bases and Queries examples.

  Differences between *NIX and Windows:
    - right now the software can work in background only in *NIX environments
    - in Windows, when writing a path on the command line (e.g.: dlv-server.exe
    -e X:\\path\\to\\dlv.exe ...), remember to use '\\' as folder separator


How to use the examples:
------------------------
  Every remote query in these files asks a local instance of the dlv-server to
  handle its requests; if needed you should change the various 'localhost' in
  the *_query.dlv files to contact the right address for the instance of the
  dlv-server that you have available.
  In the following commands we will use $DLC to indicate the DLV-Complex
  executable, when you try these on your machine substiture $DLC with the actual
  path for DLV-Complex; ours was:
    > DLC=../bin/dl-complex.linux.20100303.beta
  but yours, of course, can be anything you want.

  local_*:
  --------
    This example does not require dlv-server, just use the command:
      > $DLC examples/local_kb.dlv examples/local_query.dlv

  remote_kb_*, remote_query.dlv:
  ------------------------------
    This example does two remote queries and a local one:
      > ./dlv-server -e $DLC -k examples/remote_kb_omega1.dlv -d
      > ./dlv-server -e $DLC -k examples/remote_kb_omega2.dlv -d -p 3334
      > $DLC examples/remote_kb_omega.dlv examples/remote_query.dlv
      > kill `pidof -o %PPID dlv-server`

  remote_count_*:
  ---------------
    This example does two remote aggregate queries:
      > ./dlv-server -e $DLC -k examples/remote_count_kb_omega1.dlv -d
      > ./dlv-server -e $DLC -k examples/remote_count_kb_omega2.dlv -d -p 3334
      > $DLC examples/remote_count_query.dlv
      > kill `pidof -o %PPID dlv-server`

  remote_aggregate_*:
  -------------------
    This example is from the DLV User Manual
    (http://www.dlvsystem.com/dlvsystem/html/DLV_User_Manual.html#AEN814) and
    does one query for every (remote) aggregate function available in the system:
      > ./dlv-server -e $DLC -k examples/remote_aggregate_kb.dlv -d
      > $DLC examples/remote_aggregate_query.dlv
      > kill `pidof -o %PPID dlv-server`

  one_local_at_three_remote_queries_*:
  ------------------------------------
    This example has only one #at statement in the [...]_query.dlv file but,
    since DLV-Complex has to compute all of the answer set, that gets translated
    in as many remote inquiries to the server as the number of 'source(...).'
    facts in the [...]_kb.dlv file:
      > ./dlv-server -e $DLC -k examples/one_local_at_three_remote_queries_kb.dlv -d
      > $DLC examples/one_local_at_three_remote_queries_query.dlv
      > kill `pidof -o %PPID dlv-server`

  double_remote_*:
  ----------------
    This example shows how a query to a remote knowledge base can trigger
    another remote query that the latter presents to a third instance of our
    server:
      > ./dlv-server -e $DLC -k examples/double_remote_count_kb_omega1.dlv -d
      > ./dlv-server -e $DLC -k examples/double_remote_count_kb_omega2.dlv -d -p 3334
      > ./dlv-server -e $DLC -k examples/double_remote_count_kb_omega3.dlv -d -p 3335
      > $DLC examples/double_remote_count_query.dlv
      > kill `pidof -o %PPID dlv-server`

N.B.:
-----
  This README file is composed using Donald E. Knuth literate programming
  approach: if you are on a *NIX system and have compiled correctly all of our
  software then you can issue 'bash README' to run the examples above (provided
  that the executable for DLV-Complex is in the right place).
